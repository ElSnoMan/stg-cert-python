# attacks
ember = Attack(name='Ember', cost='FC', damage=30, effect='Discard an Energy attached to this Pok√©mon.')

water_gun = Attack('Water Gun', cost='W', damage=20, effect=None)

# pokemon
squirtle = Pokemon('Squirtle', 'Basic', 70, 'Water', attacks=[water_gun], weakness='Electric')
pikachu = Pokemon('Pikachu', 'Basic', 70, 'Electric', [thunder_shock], weakness='Fighting')

print(squirtle.hp)
pikachu.attack('Thunder Shock', squirtle)
print(squirtle.hp)


# 4. How would you handle if a Pokemon's attack is super effective?
